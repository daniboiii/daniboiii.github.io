			so im probably making it to boston at this point and thats awesome
			<br>
			this past month has been so insanely stressful with my classes and i've been so burned out trying to get everything sorted that i need to get to where i need to be. it's quite frankly a lot but if it all works out then i will be so much happier for it. i've got so much to look forward to if i just dont fuck anything up
			<br>
			ive been reflecting a lot too on my creative process. it took me a while to realize ive spent so much time trying to make cool stuff that i think i forgot that making things should be fun and fulfilling and not just something to look back on proudly like a trophy. it sucks because its been like a year since the last time i really finished anything and i still frankly dont have much to show for it. 500+ projects on my computer since 2020. 500+ ideas, and most will probably never get finished because they do not bring me joy
			<br>
			so... i guess you'll see me when i remember what this shit is supposed to actually be about. and when i figure out what i want to do with it when the dust settles (haha get it)
			<br>
			(i have no idea what im doing anymore)
