		<h1>time passes so fast and yet so slow.</h1>

			it only just now occurred to me that a full week has passed since the last (and first) time i updated this. it had to have been one of the slowest weeks of my entire life and yet now that it's slipped from my fingers it's like it passed by like nothing.
			<br>
			i honestly can't say i've gotten much done but i did start putting a discord server together (you can find an invite to it under the "extras" tab if you haven't already seen it). there is so much i want to do and so much that i NEED to do that it's a bit overwhelming to be quite honest. hopefully i can actually get around to doing some of these things soon. shout out to ritalin
			<br>
			anyway that's it i guess i just wanted to update this again. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
