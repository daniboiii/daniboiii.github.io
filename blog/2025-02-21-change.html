			currently writing this at like 1 am or so. i've got a lot on my mind right now
			<br>
			i have a job interview tomorrow (or should i say later today?). i'm like extremely nervous about it but very hopeful. if everything goes well i've got a job in the boston area once i finally graduate college (been a long time comin). 
			<br>
			i haven't been particularly active when it comes to my music career as of late, seeing as my last release was nearly a year ago like last may/june or something. i have quite a few projects/songs in the works that i hope to show yall this year, so it hasnt been completely nonproductive in that regard, but honestly i've been mainly focused on getting through my classes and spending time with my friends and my partner and shit. life has been good for the most part. hoping for it to get even better soon enough. we'll see <3
