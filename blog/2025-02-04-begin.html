			so, i finally decided to bother putting this website together, and it's been a very fun if not occasionally annoying task. it's come together very well so far!
			<br>
			i have a lot of plans for this year that might take a while to come to fruition but i know i am capable of doing it if i set my mind to it. among these include at least one ep and at least one album. i have so much music in the works i just keep jumping between numerous projects and not spending enough time with any particular thing.
			</br>
			i have also come to realize something that maybe should have been common sense. i've spent so much time trying to tell stories or express feelings through my music that i forgot that the act of creation is supposed to be fun. so expect me to have a lot more fun with working on music this year.
			<br>
			anyway i'm going to get to cooking. later!
